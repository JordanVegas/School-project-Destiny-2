Warmind
</asp:Content>
<asp:Content ID="Content5" ContentPlaceHolderID="ContentPlaceHolder4" Runat="Server">
The Warmind DLC will take players back to the planet Mars that hasn't been seen since the first game. The story revolves around players meeting Ana Bray, a Hunter who will help us find out more about her past and the Warmind known as Rasputin.<br /><br />

New Destinations<br /><br />
As with the last expansion, Curse of Osiris, players will venture into a brand new location for Destiny 2.
<br /><br />
Mars<br /><br />
Destiny 2: Warmind DLC takes players back to Mars for the first time since the original game. Instead of the red sand dunes of before, you will venture into the frozen region of Mars filled with dangers and new enemies.
<br /><br />
New Characters<br /><br />
Ana Bray<br /><br />
Ana Bray is a Hunter whom you may have heard of previously. Mentioned only through various texts, lore pieces, and adventures across both Destiny and Destiny 2, this will be the first time we interact with her in person. 
<br /><br />
With a family heritage tied directly to the Warminds and SIVA, Ana Bray will help the player uncover the secrets of her past and the Warmind, Rasputin.
<br /><br />
Rasputin<br /><br />
Constructed by Ana Bray's father, Clovis Bray, Rasputin is the last surviving Warmind. Alongside Ana Bray, the player will find out more about the Tyrant Rasputin in the Warmind DLC.
<br /><br />
Raid Changes<br /><br />
new Raid Lair<br /><br />
There is a new Raid Lair in Warmind, which is a shorter version of the traditional Raid you would suspect. This new Raid Lair, Spire of Stars, joins Curse of Osiris' Eater of Worlds. Spire of Stars will conclude the Leviathan Raid storyline introduced in Destiny 2.
<br /><br />
The Warmind DLC Raid Lair, Spire of Stars, releases shortly after the expansion on Friday, May 11th, 2018. Players will journey to a new area and encounter several smaller fights leading up to a final boss in this shorter Raid experience.
<br /><br />
Strikes<br /><br />
Destiny 2: Warmind DLC expansion will see two new Strikes added to the game for players to take on. Both will receive Nightfall versions in the weeks following the launch of the expansion.
<br /><br />
Strange Terrain<br /><br />
Strange Terrain is the first of the two Destiny 2: Warmind Strikes. In it, you will go up against Prince Nokris, whom veteran players will know as the son of Oryx and brother to Crota.
<br /><br />
Will of Thousands<br /><br />
Will of Thousands is the second Strike that will be featured prominently in Warmind. While we know about Strange Terrain, little is currently known about Will of Thousands until the expansion releases.
<br /><br />
New Game Mode<br /><br />
Instead of introducing a new traditional Public Event for players to tackle on Mars, there is an entirely new game mode that will act as the Public Event in the new location called Escalation Protocol.
<br /><br />
Escalation Protocol<br /><br />
Escalation Protocol will act as a direct response to players' concern over difficulty. It is essentially a mini-Horde mode for Destiny 2, allowing players to join up in the center of the new areas and fight against wave after wave of Hive enemies.
<br /><br />
Escalation Protocol promises challenge, new bosses, and exclusive rewards should you be able to successfully survive through to the end with other Guardians.
<br /><br />
Collectibles<br /><br />
Data<br /><br />
There will be approximately 45 Data collectibles for players to hunt down on Mars in Destiny 2: Warmind. Little is currently known about what rewards you will get from finding them.
<br /><br />
Crucible<br /><br />
New Maps<br /><br />
The Crucible will be receiving two new maps for competitive play in Warmind. Solitude and Survival will be available to all Destiny 2 players for free when the expansion releases regardless of whether or not you own the DLC.
<br /><br />
Private Matches<br /><br />
Private Matches are making a return in Destiny 2, allowing players to customize match features to their liking.
<br /><br />
Crucible Ranks<br /><br />
Warmind will introduce not one but two different Crucible Ranks for competitive players. The first of the two is Valor, a more casual Rank that rises when you play matches, win or lose. It will rise higher, though, if you win more matches.
<br /><br />
The second Crucible Rank in Warmind is Glory. Glory is more hardcore, increasing when you win but decreasing if you lose or quit a match before it's over.
<br /><br />
Prestige and rewards are available for both the Valor and Glory Crucible Ranks.
